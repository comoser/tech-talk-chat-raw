# Tech Talk - Docker beginner hands-on raw repo

This a demo app for virtualisation with docker, part of the xgeeks Tech Talks but it still has no virtualisation set :)

The app consists in a simple chat that has memory persistence with Redis.
The chat has real-time communication with other rooms through sockets.
